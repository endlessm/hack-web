- OK, a quick rundown of what we're doing here: You need to drag and drop the tiles with arrows on them so that when I follow them, I'll get to the exit safely!
- If there's a Pit, I'll need to jump over it, and if there's a Wall, I need to go around it.
- Once you have the instructions arranged how you want, press the Play button to start - and no more changing instructions until I either win or lose!
- If I fail, you'll need to rearrange the instructions until we get it right.
