- Hey {get_user_name()}, du musst das unbedingt auch ausprobieren. Ich lerne gerade eine neue Programmiersprache f√ºr Interaktive Kunst <b>p5.js</b> - "js" kommt von <b>JavaScript</b> - davon hast du bestimmt schon geh√∂rt, es ist eine Programmiersprache die auf vielen Webseiten l√§uft.

- Das <b>p5.js</b> Programm ist auf der linken Seite, und das Ergebnis von dem Programm in der Mitte. Wenn du schreibst, wird das Programm automatisch ausgef√ºhrt, und der mittlere Bereich erneuert.
- Es ist wichtig, dass du jeden Code <b>genauso</b> schreibst wie wir ihn zeigen. Computer k√∂nnen sehr pingelig sein zum Beispiel bei Leerzeichen. Wenn du etwas korrigieren m√∂chtest kannst du es Schrittweise mit <b>Ctrl + Z</b> r√ºckg√§ngig machen, oder die urspr√ºngliche Version mit dem <b>Reload</b> Knopf rechts oben wiederherstellen.

- Vergiss das Semikolon ( <b>;</b> ) am Ende der Zeile nicht, und achte auf deine Leerzeichen!

- Hmm, looks like we're going to need a bigger window to contain this wave! We can make the <b>canvas</b> (that's the name of the area the program draws things in) larger by changing the line that says <tt>createCanvas(400, 400)</tt>. Those two numbers control the width and height of your canvas, so let's make that a little bigger - increase the wdith to <b>600</b>.

- Let's move on to some fun with colors - look for the line that says <tt>arcColor = 255</tt>.
- That <b>variable</b> controls the color of all the lines in the wave - let's change it to <b>100</b>, and see what happens!

- Now your wave is gray! If you want the wave to be blue, green or some other color, we need a more complex way of talking about colors. True, you can use color words, like you did for the background, but you can also describe colors in terms of the amounts of red, green, and blue they have.
- For example, let's make the wave red - change the line with <b>arcColor</b> on it to <tt>arcColor = color(255, 0, 0);</tt>. Don't forget to double-check your spacing!

- Great job! Now <b>those</b> are some beautiful waves.
- We're at a crossroads: You can stay here and keep playing around with the colors and what we've learned so far, or... we can forge ahead into something more complicated. How does that sound?

- OK, let's get complex. We'll make the arcs change color only when you click (or touch, if you're using a tablet) that part of the sceeen.
- First, surround your existing <tt>doArcs(...</tt> code with <tt>if (mouseIsPressed) \{</tt>, and <tt>\}</tt>
- Remember to be very careful of your spacing! Your code should look like this:

- Great, one last bit: create a new line after the one you just typed, and type <tt>else \{ doArcs(128); \}</tt>
- If you're having trouble, carefully check that everything you've typed is in the correct place, with the correct spacing. Your code should look like this:

- Great job, and we can also apply the same idea to the background color!
- On the line with <tt>doArcs(...</tt>, add <tt>background(255);</tt> just before for <tt>doArcs(...</tt>

- Do you see what we've done here? We used an <b>if</b> statement to change the behavior of this program depending on what you, the user, is doing!
- If you click or touch the canvas, <tt>mouseIsPressed</tt> is <b>True</b>, so the if statement jumps to the first bit of code, and displays the arcs as your chosen color.
- If you aren't clicking on or touching the canvas, <tt>mouseIsPressed</tt> is <b>False</b>, so it runs the code inside the <b>else</b> section, and the arcs are the other color.
- You can think of <b>if</b> statements like they're a sentence - <i>If this test is true, do one thing, or else, do a different thing.</i>

- Finally, we‚Äôre going to introduce you to another power-user command: the <b>map</b> function. <b>Functions</b> take in some data, and output other data. <b>map</b> takes one set of numbers, and squishes or stretches it to fit another range of numbers. In this case, we're going to use <tt>map()</tt> to make the position of your mouse control the speed of the wave animation.

=== p5_26_de ===
- First, let's get familiar with the numbers we'll be changing. Do you see the last line of our code, <tt>theta += 0.0523;</tt>? That number controls the speed of the wave.
- <b>0.0523</b> is an awfully small number! Let's try increasing it to <tt>0.1</tt>. Remember to watch your spaces!

- Now, let‚Äôs use the map function to automate the things we did in the past few instructions. We'll make the vertical position of your cursor control the speed of the wave!
- Change the number after <tt>theta +=</tt> to <tt>map(mouseY, height, 0, 0.001, 0.1);</tt> As usual, be careful to make sure your spaces and the numbers you're typing are correct.
