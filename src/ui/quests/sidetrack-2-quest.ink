    Congratulations on your badge, {get_user_name()}! Now, let's see what this level is about... # character: ada

* [(wait for: currentLevel is 23)] Level {currentLevel -1 } Complete!
-> level23

=== level23 ===
- Hey, check out that instruction in the middle of the set. That's not a good symbol!
# character: ada
- I suppose we should try out the level anyway, just to see what happens...
* [(wait for: success is 0)] Level {currentLevel} Failed!
-> level23_fail
* [(wait for: flipped)] Flipped!
-> level23_fail

=== level23_fail ===
# character: estelle
- I think we actually have 2 problems - First, the middle instruction looks like an error. Second, even if you put that error somewhere else, we still need a <b>jump()</b> to cross those pits!
{flipped: -> level23_fail_2}

-> level23_fail_2
* [(wait for: flipped)] Flipped!
-> level23_fail_2


=== level23_fail_2 ===

- Good thing I know just the person to help! Saniel, are you there?
{flipped: -> level23_3}

# character: saniel
- What? Yes, yes, I am here. I was... <i>inemuri</i>, as the Japanese say. Sleeping while present, if you will.
{flipped: -> level23_4}

-> level23_4
* [(wait for: flipped)] Flipped!
-> level23_4


=== level23_4 ===
# character: saniel
- Ahem. Now, what do we have? A line of pits, an invalid instruction... It <b>appears</b> we're stuck, but we won't be defeated this easily! Riley, is there a way for us to look into the code and debug that instruction?
{flipped: -> level23_5}

-> level23_5
* [(wait for: flipped)] Flipped!
-> level23_5


=== level23_5 ===
- Exactly, Dr. Rowe! That's what the next step is - debug the broken code! Do you see that button on the <b>left side</b> of the screen, {get_user_name()}? That's the <b>Flip to Hack</b> button! You can use it to go behind the scenes and hack the game with the <b>Toolbox</b>. Let's go!
{flipped: -> level23_8}
~ attractFTH = 1
* [(wait for: flipped)]  Flipped!
~ attractFTH = 0
-> level23_8


=== level23_8 ===
~ hasLockKey = 1
- There's a lock here, but never fear, {get_user_name()}, here's the key! Click the lock to open it, and you'll be able to see the <b>Instructions</b>. They're the code version of the icons you dragged around on the front side of Sidetrack.
* [(wait for: isLocked is 0)]  Unlocked!
-> level23_10
* [(wait for: currentLevel is 24)] Level {currentLevel-1} Complete!
-> level24


=== level23_10 ===
- Take a close look at the instructions. If you see anything weird, try and fix it.
- You can always Undo any mistakes you make (<b>Ctrl + Z</b>), and if everything get really bad, you can always reset the code by clicking the <b>Reload</b> button in the upper right. Got it?
* [👍] Gotcha!
-> level23_11
* [👎] I'm a little lost.
-> level23_12
* [(wait for: codeErrors is 0)] Fixed it!
-> level23_flip


=== level23_12 ===
# character: ada
- Look at that middle instruction, {get_user_name()}. I'm pretty sure <b>jumpp</b> isn't a real word - and I'm positive it's not a correct <b>instruction</b>, either! Fix that, <b>flip</b> back to the front of Sidetrack, and then press the <b>Play</b> button!
* [(wait for: currentLevel is 24)] Level {currentLevel -1 } Complete!
-> level24
* [(wait for: codeErrors is 0)] Fixed it!
-> level23_flip

=== level23_11 ===
- Awesome! Fix the problem, <b>flip</b> back to the front of Sidetrack, and then press the <b>Play</b> button!
* [(wait for: codeErrors is 0)] Fixed it!
-> level23_flip

=== level23_flip ===
{not flipped: -> level23_play}
- Now <b>flip</b> back to the front of Sidetrack.

=== level24 ===

- I've been saving this badge for you, {get_user_name()} - You really know your way around Sidetrack now!
~ set_game_state("quests.achievements/sidetrack2-complete", true)
- There are still plenty of challenges ahead, though. Let's keep going, <b>flip</b> the app and hack the <b>Instructions</b> again!

- Gibbering heffalumps! That's quite a gambit, {get_user_name()}! I think I might say... how does it go... that "you're the man now, dog!"

- Good. You've corrected the errors, now <b>flip</b> back to the front of Sidetrack.

=== level24_play ===
# character: estelle
- Ok, let's give it a shot. Press the <b>Play</b> button! If you don't make it through, you might need different instructions, or a different order of instructions.
* [(wait for: currentLevel is 25)] Level {currentLevel-1} Complete!
-> level25


=== level24_3_hints ===
# character: estelle
- Look for <b>Instructions</b> that might be spelled wrong, or that don't make any sense. Remember, if you accidentally create any new errors, you can always Undo your mistakes (<b>Ctrl + Z</b>) or reset the code by clicking the <b>Reload</b> button in the upper right.

# character: faber
- Oh, hey, I think I see another problem. Look at the capitalization in the code. I think it should be <tt>riley.jump()</tt>, not <tt>riley.<b>J</b>ump()</tt>!

-> level26


=== level25_fix ===
# character: saniel
- Well done, you've fixed the errors. Now, <b>flip</b> back and see if you can complete the level. Don't forget that you might still need to re-order or change in instructions to get through.
* [(wait for: currentLevel is 26)] Level {currentLevel-1} Complete!
-> level26


=== level26 ===
# character: ada
- I don't think these errors are a mistake! Every instruction in this set is wrong, and statistically, that's very unlikely.

- You said it, Felix! Hey {get_user_name()}, you know the drill now! <b>Flip</b> and hack!

=== level26_fix ===
# character: faber
- Just because you fixed the errors doesn't mean the instructions are correct, you'll probably have to re-order them... or maybe even re-write them completely!
* [(wait for: currentLevel is 27)] Level {currentLevel-1} Complete!
-> level27


=== level27 ===
# character: ada
- It looks like this level has only two incorrect instructions - that's an improvement.

# character: faber
- Uh... That's a big wall. Can we jump a wall? Does that work?
* ❯
-> level28_2


=== level28_2 ===
# character: saniel
- You can experiment with that if you like, Faber, but judging from previous levels... probably not. I think we'll need a new tool to solve this puzzle.

-> level28_3


=== level28_3 ===
# character: faber
- Darn. Well, do we have that tool?
* ❯
-> level28_4


=== level28_4 ===
- Not yet, Faber! I haven't finished getting everything into this web version of Sidetrack, yet. If you want to solve this puzzle right now, you'll have to go into Endless OS and check out Sidetrack there!

- Ahem. I think I speak for all of us, here, when I say that we've had a great time with you, {get_user_name()}. I hope we'll see you soon in Endless OS!
